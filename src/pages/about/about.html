        <p>VASCERN, the European Reference Network on Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases, is dedicated to gathering the best expertise in Europe in order to provide accessible cross-border healthcare to patients with rare vascular diseases (an estimated 1.3 Million concerned). These include arterial disease (affecting aorta to small arteries), arterio-venous anomalies, venous malformations, and lymphatic diseases. 
            VASCERN currently consists of 31 highly specialized multidisciplinary Healthcare Providers (HCPs) from 11 EU Member States and of various European Patient Organisations (ePAG) and is coordinated in Paris, France. 
            Through our 5 Rare Disease Working Groups (RDWGs) as well as several Thematic WGs and the ePAG â€“ European Patient Advocacy Group, we aim to improve care, promote best practices and guidelines, reinforce research, empower patients, provide training for healthcare professionals and realise the full potential of European cooperation for specialised healthcare by exploiting the latest innovations in medical science and health technologies.</p>
